## Hi there! 👋 I'm Holger.

I'm learning, experimenting, and working with web technologies since the early 2000s.

🧑‍💻 Currently, I'm Lead Researcher and Software Engineer at [datavisyn](https://datavisyn.io/). Together with my team I develop novel visual analysis tools for cancer research, drug discovery, and other application areas using web technologies and frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and [Fast API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). 

🧑‍🏫 I'm also teaching *Interaction Design*, *Usability Engineering*, and *Interactive Data Visualization with D3* at the [University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/hagenberg-campus/) in Hagenberg, Austria. I enjoy well designed products that are easy to use and data visualization that scales.  

👨‍🎓 I finished my PhD at the [Institute for Computer Graphics](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computer-graphics/) at [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/en/) in 2019. My scientific areas of interest include visualization and visual analytics of multi-attribute and temporal data. I'm still [co-authoring papers](https://jku-vds-lab.at/persons/stitz/) with other researchers from academia on projects to create new visualization and visual analytics approaches that can improve our products in a later stage. You can find a list of my publications on [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=mqn0XvQAAAAJ).

<!-- Prior to this, I did my Master of Science with the focus on web technologies in [Interactive Media at the University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/hagenberg-campus/studiengaenge/master/interactive-media/). -->
